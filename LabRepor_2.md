* The methods that are called in my code are the ```main``` method and the ``handleClient`` method. The ``main`` method makes the server listen for incoming connections. While the ```handleClient``` method reads the request from the client, gets the content of the message, and username, and sends the updated chat history as a response. The relevant arguments is the GET request to the ```/add-message``` endpoint with the parameters ```s=hello``` , ```user=John``` and ```s=How%20are%20you%3F``` , ```user=Alice```.

* Something I learned in lab from week 2 and 3, that I didn't know before, is what each part of a URL meant. This is because now I know that each part of a URL serves a different purspose, and how each part serves a signifanct purpose for the connection to the specified address everyone inputs when we use the internet. I also learned about SSH, which I didn't know anything about before, but now I know that it is related to secure communication and remote access.
